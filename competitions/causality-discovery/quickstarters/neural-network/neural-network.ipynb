    "# Causal Discovery - Neural Network Baseline Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves two purposes: to introduce the participants to the competition and to provide a simple **neural network**-based submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovering causal relationships between variables from observational data is crucial in fields such as healthcare and economics. Participants are given datasets with known causal graphs to develop algorithms that uncover the underlying causal structures. The focus is on determining how other variables influence the relationship between two key variables, **`X`** (treatment) and **`Y`** (outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the proposed solution is to design a neural network that takes as input a dataset of observations $N \\times M$ ($N=1000$, $M \\leq 10$) and outputs the adjacency matrix $M \\times M$ representing its causal graph. The proposed neural network architecture is inspired by the [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)) model, and aims to capture non-symmetric relationships between variables, thus providing directional information about the arrows between each pair of variables. In addition, this implementation uses *masking* to handle different numbers of variables $N$ in different datasets, ensuring that the input dataset is always modeled as $1000 \\times 10$, with a mask applied when there are fewer than 10 variables. Another key design choice is to make the neural network invariant to both the order of the rows in the input dataset - since the observations have no particular order and are **not** time series - and the order of the variables. The network outputs a (masked) $N \\times N$ matrix of probability values in the range $[0,1]$. A final post-processing step converts the predicted probabilities in each entry of the adjacency matrix to binary values (0s and 1s) to create a DAG using a simple heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below contains the following components based on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Manipulation**: Creates a `PyTorch` dataset from the competition data (`CausalDataset`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neural Network Architecture**: Defines the neural network architecture and data processing (`CausalModel`), as well as the wrapper (`ModelWrapper`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heuristics and Graph Functions**: Provides convenience functions to manipulate causal DAGs, including the heuristic to convert predicted probabilities in the adjacency matrix into a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Local Training and Evaluation**: Trains the proposed model locally and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Submission**: Uses the model within the CrunchDAO submission interface to generate the final submission."

    "1. Transform input from (N, M) to (M, M) output.\n",

    "#### Key Parts of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CausalModel**:\n",
    "   - This is the main neural network. It processes input data and tries to produce an output that represents relationships between variables.\n",
    "   - The model has two major layers:\n",
    "     - **Input Layer**: This layer transforms the input data using a linear transformation (a fancy way of changing the shape of the data), applies a ReLU activation (to introduce non-linearity), and then applies another linear transformation. The result is split into two parts: `q` (query) and `k` (key).\n",
    "     - **Final Layer**: After processing the data, this layer combines everything and produces the output.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention** (line with `einsum`):\n",
    "  - The key operation here is **Scaled Dot Product Attention**, which helps the model figure out directional relationships between variables.\n",
    "  - This operation uses the query (`q`) and key (`k`) we calculated earlier. The code:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = torch.einsum('b s i d, b s j d -> b i j d', q, k) * (x.shape[1] ** -0.5)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    performs the attention operation by multiplying the query and key tensors together, where the indices mean `b`: data set, `s`: observation in the data set, `i`: node in the graph (potential cause), `j`: node in the graph (potential consequence), `d`: dimension of the latent representations of the nodes.The query `q` is a latent representation of potential causes; the key `k` is a latent representation of potential consequences; we use different latent representations to be able to separate causes from consequences.\n",
    "    This helps the model learn how different variables interact. The result is scaled by the size of the input, which is a common trick to improve stability during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ModelWrapper**:\n",
    "   - This is a wrapper that organizes the training process. It makes the model easier to train with PyTorch Lightning.\n",
    "   - It also defines:\n",
    "     - **Loss Function**: The model uses **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**, which is used for tasks where we are predicting yes/no answers (like whether two variables are related or not).\n",
    "     - **Optimizer**: We use the **Adam Optimizer**, which adjusts the weights of the model to improve its predictions.\n",
    "     - **Learning Rate Scheduler**: This reduces the learning rate after 7 epochs (a step in training) to help the model fine-tune its predictions as training progresses."
