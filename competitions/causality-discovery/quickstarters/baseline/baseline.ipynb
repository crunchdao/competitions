    "## DAG Competition - Baseline Notebook\n",

    "The purpose of this notebook is both to introduce participants to the competition and to suggest some possible starting points. The suggestions presented here are not binding, of course, and can be taken in any number of directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of discovering causal relationships among variables from observational data is important in fields like healthcare and economics. Participants in this competition receive datasets with known causal graphs to develop algorithms that reveal the underlying causal structures. The focus is on identifying how other variables influence the relationship between two key variables, X (treatment) and Y (outcome). Both unsupervised and supervised methods are welcome, with evaluation based on the accuracy of predicted causal links. Successful solutions will improve causal inference methods, aiding decision-making and understanding in various domains."
