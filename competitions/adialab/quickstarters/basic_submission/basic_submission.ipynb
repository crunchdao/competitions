    "## A code competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is divided in two phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission phase - 12 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-Sample phase - 12 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first phase, participants will submit Python notebooks or Python scripts which build their best possible model on the data proposed by the organizers. In the second phase, also called [Out-of-Sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) (OOS) phase, the participant's code will be automatically executed by the platform on unseen data. During this phase, the participants won't be able to modify their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participants won't be able to game or cheat their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Overfitting](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=634087103098022017102089127026118070055022030067038035066070070118003108076075122073107013020035005031116084117030102014013119017036066065011126115081078006004108029033051020066006092025091103065117104075029100098011096065096065079019015002101078070&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) of the training data will lead to very bad performance OOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility of your work, you will need to follow certain coding guidelines to participate in the competition. These guidelines will also allow our scoring system to run your code in the cloud during the OOS period without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, CrunchDAO acts as a third party intermediary and will never communicate this code to the organizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Coding Guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission needs at least to provide three components: imports, `train()`, and `infer()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **imports**: As with any script, if your solution contains dependencies on external packages make sure to import them. The system will automatically install your dependancies. Make sure that you are using only packages that are whitelisted [here](https://adialab.crunchdao.io/submit?tab=libraries).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`train()`**: In the training phase the users will build the model and train it such that it can perform inferences on the testing data. The model must be saved in the `resources` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`infer()`**: In the inference function the model trained in the previous step will be loaded and used to perform inferences on a data sample matching the characteristic of the training test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring on the public leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the reliability of the public leaderboard, you don't have access to all of the testing data on which you will be scored.\n",
    "The `X_test` data downloaded in your workspace is composed of **only** 5 dates to test locally that your code actually runs when submitted. Notice that `y_test` is not available for those 5 dates.\n",
    "Once you have uploaded your solution the system will run your code on a larger test set of approximately 30 dates, and compute the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "When submitting, you are left to decide how frequently to retrain your model, considering the limit of 5 hours of resources / week / user allowed to predict the 30 dates of the private test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring on the out-of-sample phase\n",
    "\n",
    "During the out-of-sample phase, after the submission period ends, the system will call your code 3 times every week on live datapoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean spearman score after 12 weeks of OOS will determine the winners of the tournament.\n"
