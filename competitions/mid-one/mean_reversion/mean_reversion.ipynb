    "This notebook tries to predict whether a time-series will go up or down on average - though only when it has a strong opinion. To be precise, our attacker will consume a univariate sequence of numerical data points $x_1, x_2, \\dots x_t$ and try to exploit deviations from the [martingale property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)), which is to say that we expect the series $x_t$ to satisfy:\n",
